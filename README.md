# DESCRIPTION

Was looking for a tool that could recursively list package dependencies given an initial package name. But there wasn't! This script is the only know stand-alone script on github to recursively list the name of dependencies given a package name.

# PREREQS  

-yumdownloader (Should be in yum-utils)
-root access
